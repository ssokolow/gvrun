**RETIRED:** I no longer work in Vala and, if I choose to do something like
this in the future, I'll start over in Rust.

gvrun is a lightweight, desktop-independent, GTK+-based Run dialog which attempts to mimic the look and feel of [gmrun](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmrun/) while compensating for the areas where it falls short.

# Features

 * Just Worksâ„¢ wherever feasible.
   * Resolves `~` and `~user` in paths.
   * Respects your desktop's settings for opening files and URLs by using `xdg-open`.
   * Executes shell script snippets in your preferred shell via `$SHELL`.
 * Can be used as a backend by other GUIs such as the IceWM and AwesomeWM address bar widgets. Just pass the command as an argument.
 * Stays resident and does its own global hotkey-binding for better responsiveness than gmrun when the system is heavily loaded.
 * Lightweight and fast. Written in [Vala](https://live.gnome.org/Vala) for easy maintenance without the weight of a non-native language like [Python](http://www.python.org/).
 * Minimal dependencies. Requires only GTK+, [Libgee](https://live.gnome.org/Libgee), and Xlib for keybinding.
 * Clean, well-commented source. Useful as a reference example for how to accomplish quite a few common tasks with the Glib API.
 * **(Pending)** Auto-completion not confused by hidden files and directories.
 * **(Pending)** Notification of non-success exit conditions via libnotify.

**Note:** At present, it's in an early stage of development, so the following caveats apply:

 * Auto-completion and command history haven't been implemented yet.
 * "Run in Terminal" is incomplete.
 * I haven't set up any kind of config parsing yet, so all configuration values are currently hard-coded.
 * I haven't figured out how to test for POSIX vs. Win32 from Vala so, if you get it building on Windows, it'll ignore `%COMSPEC%` in favor of `%SHELL%`.

If you still want to try it, it requires GTK+ 3.x (2.x may work if the Makefile is adjusted but is untested) and libgee.

# Installation

To build on Ubuntu (probably Debian too), it only takes three commands:

    sudo cp supplemental/xdg-* /usr/bin/
    sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libgee-dev valac
    make

(As of this writing, there are bugs and shortcomings in the released version of `xdg-open` and `xdg-terminal` has not been released. I have filed bug reports and submitted patches but they have not made it into any distros yet. Hence the installation of the included copies of `xdg-open` and `xdg-terminal` as part of the setup process for gvrun.)

# Usage

The default hotkey is WinKey+Space ("`<Mod4>space`" in GTK+ accelerator parlance) and is easy to see and edit at the top of `gvrun.vala` until I can get around to implementing a config file.

To replicate the functionality of the `URL_*` and `EXT:` keys from `~/.gmrunrc`, set custom associations in your desktop's control panel. (This has the side-benefit of working in all applications, not just gvrun)

See the [FAQ/PAQ](https://github.com/ssokolow/gvrun/wiki/Potentially-Asked-Questions) page for instructions if your desktop lacks a GUI for this.
